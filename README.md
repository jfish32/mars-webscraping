# mars-webscraping

Repo contains 2 notebooks and one exported csv from notebook 2.

Analysis from notebook 2 as follows:
-12 months on Mars
-1,867 days of data were included

Month 3 has the coldest minimum temperature on Mars, and month 8 is the warmest.

Month 6 had the lowest average pressure and month 9 had the highest.

Looking at the minimum temperature graphs to estimate a year, the low peak is somewhere around 475 and the next low peak is at about 1100. High peaks are about 750 to 1400. This gets me an average of about 637 days per year. After googling, the average Mars year is 687 Earth days, so visual guess was close and within 25%.
